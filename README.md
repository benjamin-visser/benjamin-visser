- 👋 Hi, I’m @benjamin-visser
- 👀 I’m interested in artificial intelligence (AI), specifically deep learning and computer vision, for the healthcare industry and research in physiology.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning quite a few things online:
   1. Deep learning:
   - I'm working through MIT's Introduction to Deep Learning course material in tandem with Udacity's free Deep learning with Pytorch course and Tensorflow's 
     tutorials.
   2. Statistics:
   - Udacity's free Introduction to Statistics course.
   3. Classical machine learning:
   - Udacity's free Introduction to Machine Learning course.
   4. Application of AI in healthcare:
   - I'm revising Udacity's AI for healthcare Nanodegree which I graduated from.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
